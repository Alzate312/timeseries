# Machine Learning with TimeSeries and Sequence Data - AMLD 2018

This repo contains materials for the "Modeling timeseries and sequence data on AWS using Apache
MXNet and Gluon" workshop at [Applied ML Days](https://www.appliedmldays.org/) 2018. In this
workshop we learn how to model generic sequence data and timeseries data to do sequence prediction,
forecasting future timeseries, anomaly detection to name a few. We will use Apache MXNet a scalable
deep learning framework to train our neural networks. Once trained we will explore various scalable
deployment options on AWS for both real-time and batch inference.

## Agenda

1. [Introduction to ApacheMXNet and Gluon - Crash Course](intro_mxnet_gluon)
2. [Univariate TimeSeries](univariate_timeseries_forecasting_lstm.ipynb)
3. [Multivariate TimeSeries Forecasting](multivariate_timeseries_forecasting.ipynb)
4. [TimeSeries Forecasting with DeepAR](sagemaker-timeseries)
5. [Seq2Seq with Apache MXNet](seq2seq)
